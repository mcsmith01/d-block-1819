# Class Work for D Block, 2018-2019

This is the project in which we will do most, if not all, of our coding in class. Each day, one of you will be tasked, at random, to clone this project and be the class coder. All are encouraged to code on their own, but this project will represent the norm for the class, and we will always continue from where we left off in this project.
